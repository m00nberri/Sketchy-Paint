# Sketchy-Paint

My take on the Etch-A-Sketch project in the Odin project.

The project calls simply for a basic way to draw on a grid of squares in black and white. However, I wanted to make something with a little bit more functionality.

I decided to make something similar to a very very basic version of Microsoft Paint.

There are definitely a lot of bugs within some of the more complex tools (the fill tool mostly), so please let me know of any of them you find.
